<h2>Resolving problems</h2>

    The simplest action is to recycle the Avid software alone.
    This restarts the software which manages the control behaviour.
    Recycling this may resolve issues in control responsiveness.
    It is also the mechanism to restart after the software is updated.
    When the Avid software is recycled, nothing stops playing or recording.

<p class="problemText">
    There is an occasional problem in the Yamaha AV receiver which causes the screen to blank every few seconds.
    Restarting the receiver fixes this. 
    The audio and video outputs stop briefly when restarting, but anything playing or recording will continue to do so.

<p class="problemText">
    For all other problems, where playing becomes unreliable, it may be necessary to reboot the entire Avid media PC.
    Rebooting will halt all playing and will also stop any TV recordings in progress.
    You will need to confirm that you are OK with this.
